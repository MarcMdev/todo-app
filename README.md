# //Todo App
A Todo app created in React, Node and Postgresql

I wanted to learn how to create a React app with a backend, so thought this would be a good start. Feel free to contribute as you'd like

## Todo
* Figure out best backend db to use - I'm familiar with Postgresql but any other should work (Mongodb?)
* How do we seperate out components?
* Add items
* Display items
* Remove items
* Create login system?
